## Async flows with callbacks

- We can use callbacks to handle async functions
- Tradition error handling won't work with async functions (cannot catch errors with try catch)
- Multiple nested callbacks can lead to **callback hell**

## Using promises

- Promises suggest a better syntax to handle callbacks
- Multiple async calls can be handled more gracefully
- Promise can either be **resolved** or **rejected**
